Makefile:
Builds executable, cleans directory, makes tarball.

lab1a.c:
Source code of program.
- no options
  Will display keyboard input to standard output
  Program has exit option C-d
- --shell option
  Will pass input and output between terminal and child process
  Program has several exit options such as C-c and C-d and "exit"

Testing:
Program was tested by building the executable and running the no option and --shell option on it. Seems to work generally fine according to the spec.

Limitations:
Program sometimes prints exit messages twice, or prints random exit numbers. Did not have time to resolve this thoroughly.
